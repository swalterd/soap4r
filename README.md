# soap4r
This is a fork of the soap4r project as imported to GitHub by spox. Changes have been made to fix libxml support and have it work with modern versions of Ruby / Rails. The test suite is broken and many other things here need to be updated. This library is based on very old code and help is needed to update it to get all the tests suites to pass.
